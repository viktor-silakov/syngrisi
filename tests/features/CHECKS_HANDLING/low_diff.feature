Feature: Low images difference
    This feature checks if images with a low difference (rawMisMatchPercentage, e.q.: 0.001) are properly compared

    Background:
        Given I clear Database and stop Server
        Given I start Server and start Driver

    Scenario: Low images difference
        Given I create "1" tests with:
        """
          testName: TestName
          checks:
              - checkName: CheckName
                filePath: files/low_diff_0.png
        """
        When I accept via http the 1st check with name "CheckName"

        Given I create "1" tests with:
        """
          testName: TestName
          checks:
              - checkName: CheckName
                filePath: files/low_diff_1.png
        """

        Then I expect via http 2st check filtered as "name=CheckName" matched:
        """
          name: CheckName
          status: [new]
        """
        Then I expect via http 1st check filtered as "name=CheckName" matched:
        """
          name: CheckName
          status: [failed]
