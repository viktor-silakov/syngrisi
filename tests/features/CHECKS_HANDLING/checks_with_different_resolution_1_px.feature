  Background:
    Given I clear Database and stop Server
    Given I start Server and start Driver

  Scenario: Two checks with identical image parts but different resolutions [1px, bottom]
    Given I create "1" tests with:
    """
      testName: Checks with different resolutions 1px - 1
      checks:
          - checkName: CheckName
            filePath: files/A_cropped_bottom_1_px.png
    """
    When I accept via http the 1st check with name "CheckName"

    Given I create "1" tests with:
    """
      testName: Checks with different resolutions 1px - 2
      checks:
          - checkName: CheckName
            filePath: files/A.png
    """

    When I expect via http 1st test filtered as "name=Checks with different resolutions 1px - 2" matched:
    """
      status: Passed
    """

    When I expect via http 1st check filtered as "name=CheckName" matched:
    """
      status: [passed]
    """
    When I open the app
